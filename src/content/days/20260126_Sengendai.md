## Overview

Sixteen thousand steps of exploration took Nate, Bear, and Dave from suburban ramen shops to an underground infrastructure project on a scale that defies comprehension. The Underground Shaft Experience — a massive water tunnel beneath Saitama — revealed the hidden systems keeping Tokyo running, while dinner under the train tracks in Kinshicho proved that this city finds ways to fit life into every corner. Tokyo was beginning to reveal itself as something much larger than a collection of neighborhoods.

## Moments & Notes

- **First subway ride:** The morning train from Shinjuku to Sengendai was a shock — no announcements, no conversations, just people respectfully sharing space. The quiet, orderly ride hit home: this is what "I'm really in Japan" feels like.
- **The Shaft:** Nate called it the "Punishment Tank" — but couldn't get over the scale. The [Underground Shaft Experience](https://gaikaku.jp/course/) concrete tunnel stretching endlessly underground, with a walkway perched along the top, felt like something out of a sci-fi movie.
- **Under the tracks:** Yakitori dinner at [Torikei](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wWpFzUef5PhNuyi28) happened directly beneath active train tracks. Every time a train passed overhead, the whole restaurant gently shook. Only in Tokyo.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** Described the Underground Shaft as a "Punishment Tank" but was blown away by the "incredible scale." The walkway around the top of the shaft was his favorite part.
- **Bear:** The first subway ride was the moment it hit him: "I'm really in Japan." The quiet, orderly trains felt like another world.

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: This day started with our first subway ride — and that's when it really hit us: the trains run on time and nobody talks on them, just quiet, respectful cooperation. Bear said "I'm really in Japan" watching the orderly silence. Then came the [Underground Shaft Experience](https://gaikaku.jp/course/) — a massive tunnel so big it has a walkway attached to the ceiling. Nate called it the "Punishment Tank." Lunch was ramen and gyoza at [Mansyu](http://www.mansyu.co.jp/), dinner was yakitori at [Torikei](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wWpFzUef5PhNuyi28) under train tracks that rumbled overhead. We walked 16,000 steps, and that's just how Tokyo works.
