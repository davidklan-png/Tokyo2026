## Overview

Day two in Japan was a proper introduction to just how big Tokyo can be. Starting with ramen and gyoza in Sengendai, the group picked up a rental car and drove to Kasukabe for the Underground Shaft Experience — a truly impressive course that defies easy description. The day wrapped up back in Kinshicho with dinner at a yakitori restaurant situated directly under the train tracks. Sixteen thousand steps later, everyone was starting to understand the scale of this city.

## Moments & Notes

- **The Shaft:** Nate described the Underground Shaft Experience with one word: "Punishment Tank" — but also noted the "incredible scale." The walkway around the top was the standout feature.
- **Yakitori under the tracks:** Dinner was served at a restaurant literally positioned under the train tracks — a uniquely Tokyo dining experience.
- **Step count:** The day's walking totaled 16,000 steps, a proper introduction to just how much ground you cover in this city.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** Described the Underground Shaft as a "Punishment Tank" but was blown away by the "incredible scale." The walkway around the top of the shaft was his favorite part.
- **Bear:** (No specific comment for this day)

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: Imagine a place so big underground that it has its own walkway *on top* of it. That's the Shaft — and according to Nate, it's like a "punishment tank" but in the best way possible. Lunch was ramen and gyoza (those delicious fried dumplings you might've tried back home), and dinner was yakitori — grilled chicken skewers — served at a restaurant built directly under the train tracks. Every time a train passed overhead, the whole place would rumble a little. 16,000 steps in one day. Welcome to Tokyo walking.
