## Overview

Day six delivered three Tokyo icons in sequence: hot cocktails in Ueno Park, the sensory explosion of Ameyokocho street market, and Akihabara's electric town on a Sonic hunt. The [Tokyo Hot Cocktail Festival](https://tokyo-hotcocktail.jimdosite.com/) served apple-themed creativity while Ankit joined the crew. Then came Akihabara, anime capital of Japan, in search of Sonic the Hedgehog merchandise. The verdict: Sonic doesn't exist in Japan. But the waffles, pancakes, and candy variety packs definitely do.

- **The Sonic hunt:** Multiple Akihabara shops, anime capital of Japan, zero Sonic merchandise. Bear's verdict: "No, he doesn't exist in Japan."
- **Candy variety packs:** Those assortments of weird and wonderful snacks make perfect souvenirs.
- **Ameyokocho energy:** The street market delivers sensory overload — stalls crammed with everything, crowds, chaos, somehow perfectly organized.

- **Bear:** Favorite drink: "The two apple drinks." On finding Sonic in Akihabara: "No, he doesn't exist in Japan." Something he bought: "Candy variety packs."

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: The [Tokyo Hot Cocktail Festival](https://tokyo-hotcocktail.jimdosite.com/) is exactly what it sounds like — hot cocktails in a park. Only in Japan. Then Ameyokocho, this insane street market with stalls crammed full of everything. Then Akihabara, anime and video game capital, where we hunted for Sonic the Hedgehog merchandise. Surely Japan, home of Sonic, would have plenty, right? Bear searched multiple shops and delivered his verdict: "Sonic doesn't exist in Japan." We found waffles, pancakes, and candy variety packs instead. Sometimes the hunt is the point.
