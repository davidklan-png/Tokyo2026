## Overview

Day six delivered three Tokyo icons in sequence: hot cocktails in Ueno Park, the sensory explosion of Ameyokocho street market, and Akihabara's electric town on a Sonic hunt. The [Tokyo Hot Cocktail Festival](https://tokyo-hotcocktail.jimdosite.com/) served apple-themed creativity while Ankit joined the crew. Then came Akihabara, anime capital of Japan, in search of Sonic the Hedgehog merchandise. The verdict: Sonic doesn't exist in Japan. But the waffles, pancakes, and candy variety packs definitely do.

- **The Sonic hunt:** Multiple Akihabara shops, anime capital of Japan, zero Sonic merchandise. Bear's verdict: "No, he doesn't exist in Japan."
- **Candy variety packs:** Those assortments of weird and wonderful snacks make perfect souvenirs.
- **Ameyokocho energy:** [Ameyokocho](https://www.tokyopocketguide.com/tokyo/ameyoko.html) street market delivers sensory overload — stalls crammed with everything, crowds, chaos, somehow perfectly organized.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** Favorite drink: "AppleJam."
- **Bear:** Favorite drink: "The two apple drinks." On finding Sonic in Akihabara: "No, he doesn't exist in Japan." Something he bought: "Candy variety packs."

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: The [Tokyo Hot Cocktail Festival](https://tokyo-hotcocktail.jimdosite.com/) is exactly what it sounds like — hot cocktails in [Ueno Park](https://www.kensetsu.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/jimusho/toubuk/ueno/). Only in Japan. Then [Ameyokocho](https://www.tokyopocketguide.com/tokyo/ameyoko.html), this insane street market with stalls crammed full of everything. Then [Akihabara](https://www.akiba.or.jp/), anime and video game capital, where we hunted for Sonic the Hedgehog merchandise. Surely Japan, home of Sonic, would have plenty, right? Bear searched multiple shops and delivered his verdict: "Sonic doesn't exist in Japan." We found waffles, pancakes, and candy variety packs instead. Sometimes the hunt is the point.
