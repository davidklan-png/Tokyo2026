## Overview

The long flight across the date line ended with touchdown at Narita — Nate and Bear aboard ANA's fully reclining pods, a private van ride through Tokyo, then arrival at The Knot Shinjuku. But before any jet lag could set in, Dave introduced them to their first izakaya, a late-night feast that set the tone: this trip would be about food, hospitality, and discovering the unfamiliar together.

## Moments & Notes

- **Pod life:** Nate discovered the joy of ANA's fully reclining seats — a game-changer for long-haul flights across the Pacific.
- **Private van arrival:** After the long flight, a hired van carried Nate and Bear from Narita to Shinjuku — first glimpse of Tokyo passing by outside the windows.
- **First izakaya:** [Kakureya](https://kakureya080808.com/) served small plates one after another, everything unfamiliar and delicious. Grilled skewers, pickled vegetables, things they couldn't identify but all wanted to try. This was how you eat in Japan.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** The izakaya dinner stood out immediately — small plates arriving one after another, everything unfamiliar and delicious.
- **Bear:** (No specific comment for arrival day)

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: The flights were long, but landing in Tokyo felt like stepping onto another planet. A private van carried us from the airport to the hotel, first glimpse of the city passing by. Dad's first move was an izakaya dinner at [Kakureya](https://kakureya080808.com/), where small plates kept arriving: grilled skewers, pickled vegetables, things we couldn't identify but all wanted to try. This was the beginning.
