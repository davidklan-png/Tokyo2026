## Overview

The journey from Chicago to Tokyo marks the official start of Nate and Bear's Japanese adventure. After crossing the international date line, flight NH11 landed a little early at Narita at 2:30PM on January 25th. From there, it was a long ride from Narita to The Knot hotel, and a late-night izakaya dinner that set the tone for the days to come.

- **First impressions:** The sheer scale of Tokyo, combined with how quiet and organized everything felt, made an immediate impact.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** "The izakaya near the hotel Dave took us to when we got there" was his first memorable moment. He also noted that being able to lay down in the pods on the flight was a highlight.
- **Bear:** Cited "The first quiet and orderly ride" as the moment that made him think "I'm really in Japan."

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: The flights were long, but touching down in Tokyo felt like stepping into another world. The trains don't just run on time — they're *quiet*. People actually wait in lines. Dad's first move was to take everyone to an izakaya — a Japanese pub where the food comes in small plates and the atmosphere is pure energy. Welcome to Japan!
