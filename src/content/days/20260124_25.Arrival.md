## Overview

The long flight across the date line ended with touchdown in Tokyo — a completely different world of quiet trains and orderly crowds. But before any jet lag could set in, Dave introduced Nate and Bear to their first izakaya, a late-night feast that set the tone: this trip would be about food, hospitality, and discovering the unfamiliar together.

## Moments & Notes

- **Pod life:** Nate discovered the joy of ANA's fully reclining seats — a game-changer for long-haul flights.
- **Quiet trains:** The subway ride was a shock — no announcements, no conversations, just people respectfully sharing space.
- **First izakaya:** Small plates arrived one after another, everything unfamiliar and delicious. This was how you eat in Japan.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** The izakaya dinner stood out immediately.
- **Bear:** The quiet subway ride was the moment it hit him: "I'm really in Japan."

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: The flights were long, but landing in Tokyo felt like stepping onto another planet. The trains run on time and nobody talks on them — just quiet, respectful cooperation. Dad's first move was an izakaya dinner, where small plates kept arriving: grilled skewers, pickled vegetables, things we couldn't identify but all wanted to try. This was the beginning.
