## Overview

The final day arrived with mixed emotions — sad to leave, grateful for everything. At 10:30 AM, Dave saw Nate and Bear off on the Limousine Bus to Haneda Airport. From there, it was the Narita Sky Lounge for a few hours of relaxation before flight JA56 departed at 5 PM. Bear's final meal in Japan was beef curry at the Sakura Lounge — a fitting end. The departure was bittersweet, but as Nate said later, the trip was "as good as it could be without having the kids around." Bear's wish list for next time says it all: more junk food, more temple time, DisneySea, and "all the food, all over again."

## Moments & Notes

- **The departure:** Dave waving goodbye as the Limousine Bus pulled away at 10:30 AM. End of an era.
- **Final meal:** Beef curry at the Sakura Lounge. Bear made sure to note this one down — proper send-off food.
- **Sky Lounge reflection:** A few hours to sit, think, and let it all sink in. The Narita Sky Lounge is a decent place for that.
- **Already planning the return:** Bear's list for next time says it all: more junk food, more time at the temple, some nature walks, out-of-Tokyo experiences, DisneySea, and "all the food, all over again."

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** On his final thoughts: "As good as it could be without having the kids around." One thing he wants to do when he comes back: "Relaxed countryside/mountains stay."
- **Bear:** On what he wants to do next time: "More junk food, more time sitting and people watching. More time at the temple. Some nature walks and some out of Tokyo experiences. DisneySea. All the food, all over again." His message to you kids: "Beautiful city, lots of walking, lots of food and adult drinking. The most memorable parts of the trip were the people, not the destinations. Dave and Taz as our gracious hosts, Dave's surrogate mother who looked at him with doting eyes relentlessly at the first restaurant, Dave's friends who owned the restaurant and were so warm and welcoming, Ankit's constant laughter. Even our Aussie and New Zealander sumo wrestling friends on the train were a joy. The people of Japan as a whole were friendly and welcoming, perhaps sometimes disingenuous, but you never noticed."

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: And just like that, it was over. The Limousine Bus picked us up at 10:30 AM. Dave waved goodbye. We headed to Haneda Airport, relaxed in the Narita Sky Lounge for a few hours, and had one last meal — beef curry at the Sakura Lounge. Bear made sure to write that down. At 5 PM, flight JA56 took off, and Tokyo became a memory instead of a place we were standing in.

Nate said it was "as good as it could be without having the kids around." Bear said the most memorable parts weren't the places — they were the people. Dave and Taz, who hosted us like family. Dave's "surrogate mother" at that first restaurant, looking at him with "doting eyes relentlessly." The friends who owned the restaurant, so warm and welcoming. Ankit's constant laughter. Even random strangers on the train — Aussie and New Zealander sumo wrestlers who became friends. Bear's message to you: "Beautiful city, lots of walking, lots of food and adult drinking." The people were "friendly and welcoming, perhaps sometimes disingenuous, but you never noticed."

We're already planning the next one. Bear wants more junk food, more temple time, DisneySea, nature walks, and "all the food, all over again." He also said: "Relaxed countryside/mountains stay." So there's more to come.

Until next time, Tokyo.
