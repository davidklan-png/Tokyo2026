## Overview

Goodbyes are never easy, but this one carried something extra: the weight of a trip that exceeded expectations. At 10:30 AM, the Limousine Bus pulled away from The Knot with Nate and Bear aboard, headed back toward Michigan. Their final meal in Japan — beef curry at the Sakura Lounge — felt appropriately significant. They left already planning the return: more junk food, more temple time, DisneySea, nature outside the city, and "all the food, all over again." The most common sentiment wasn't about places at all — it was about people.

## Moments & Notes

- **The send-off:** Watching the bus pull away with Nate and Bear marked the end of hosting duties for Dave — but the beginning of their next chapter together.
- **Bear's curry:** The Sakura Lounge's beef curry was a final taste of Japan worth documenting.
- **Already planning the return:** Between Nate's "countryside/mountains stay" and Bear's extensive list (DisneySea, more temples, all the food again), nobody was pretending this was a one-time visit.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** "As good as it could be without having the kids around." He wants a relaxed countryside or mountains stay next time.
- **Bear:** "The most memorable parts weren't the destinations — they were the people. Dave and Taz, our gracious hosts. Dave's friends at the restaurant, so warm and welcoming. Ankit's laughter. Even the Aussie and New Zealander sumo wrestlers we met on the train."

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: The Limousine Bus picked us up at 10:30 AM. Dave waved goodbye. We spent our last hours in the Narita Sky Lounge, eating beef curry one last time and watching the planes. At 5 PM, flight JA56 took off, and Tokyo became a memory instead of a place we were standing in.

Nate said the trip was "as good as it could be without having the kids around." But Bear said what stuck with him wasn't the places — it was the people. Dave and Taz, who took us in like family. The restaurant owners who welcomed us so warmly. Ankit, always laughing. Even random strangers on the train who became friends.

We're already planning the next trip — DisneySea, more temples, countryside, mountains, and every meal all over again. This isn't goodbye. It's "until next time."
