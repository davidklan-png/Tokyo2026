## Overview

After days of epic step counts and ambitious itineraries, day seven was designed as a contrast: a proper relax day. Nate and Bear took it slow with tea shopping, a tour of Japanese grocery stores (more exciting than it sounds), and what was essentially a junk food sampling expedition — Hot Lemonade, White Grape soda, and something called lactic acid soda. The evening brought excellent craft beer at [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/) and [Y.Y.G. Brewery & Beer Kitchen](http://www.yygbrewery.com/), where Nate discovered a Jalapeño IPA that somehow worked. Sometimes the best days are the ones without a master plan.

## Timeline

**Morning/Afternoon**
- Tea shopping at local shops
- Tour a Japanese grocery store (the underground ones are fascinating)
- Junk food sampling: Hot Lemonade, White Grape soda, lactic acid soda
- Wander and discover at a relaxed pace

**Evening**
- [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/) for craft beer
- Continue to [Y.Y.G. Brewery & Beer Kitchen](http://www.yygbrewery.com/)
- Nate's discovery: Jalapeño IPA
- Bear's find: Triple beer at [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/)

## Moments & Notes

- **Grocery store tourism:** Bear genuinely enjoyed "wandering the underground groceries." Japanese convenience stores and supermarkets are an experience unto themselves — the variety, the packaging, the strange snacks.
- **Junk food adventure:** Hot Lemonade, White Grape soda, and lactic acid soda. Three flavors, three uniquely Japanese experiences.
- **Craft beer scene:** [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/) offered excellent options — Bear went with a Triple. [Y.Y.G. Brewery & Beer Kitchen](http://www.yygbrewery.com/) delivered on quality too; Nate's Jalapeño IPA was the standout.
- **The pace:** After 26,000-step days and intense itineraries, a slower day was exactly what everyone needed. Tokyo rewards wandering just as much as it rewards planning.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** Favorite drink: "YYG was great, Jalapepo IPA" (Jalapeño IPA). Favorite food: The glazed sweet potato chips were good.
- **Bear:** Favorite drinks: "Triple at the [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/), a few interesting beers at the [Y.Y.G. Brewery & Beer Kitchen](http://www.yygbrewery.com/)." Weird/fun snacks: "Hot Lemonade, White Grape soda, lactic acid soda." Something small he enjoyed: "Wandering the underground groceries."

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: Today was about taking a breath. No 26,000-step marching orders. Instead, we went tea shopping — Japan takes tea seriously, and the variety is incredible. We toured grocery stores, which sounds boring but is actually fascinating when you're looking at aisle after aisle of snacks you've never seen before. We tried Hot Lemonade (spicy lemonade, basically), White Grape soda, and something called lactic acid soda (don't ask, just try it). The evening was all about craft beer — [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/) and [Y.Y.G. Brewery & Beer Kitchen](http://www.yygbrewery.com/). Nate found a Jalapeño IPA that sounds terrible but apparently wasn't. Sometimes the best days in Tokyo are the ones where you just... wander. No itinerary, no master plan. Just curiosity and good company.
