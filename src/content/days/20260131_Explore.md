## Overview

After days of 26,000-step marches, day seven was designed as a contrast: slow down. Nate and Bear went tea shopping, toured underground grocery stores (more exciting than it sounds), and launched a junk food sampling expedition — Hot Lemonade, White Grape soda, lactic acid soda. The evening brought craft beer excellence at [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/) and [Y.Y.G. Brewery & Beer Kitchen](http://www.yygbrewery.com/), where Nate discovered that Jalapeño IPA somehow works. Sometimes the best days have no master plan.

## Timeline

**Morning/Afternoon**
- Tea shopping at local shops
- Tour Japanese grocery stores (underground)
- Junk food sampling: Hot Lemonade, White Grape soda, lactic acid soda
- Wander at a relaxed pace

**Evening**
- [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/) for craft beer
- [Y.Y.G. Brewery & Beer Kitchen](http://www.yygbrewery.com/)
- Nate discovers Jalapeño IPA
- Bear enjoys Triple beer

## Moments & Notes

- **Grocery store tourism:** Bear genuinely enjoyed "wandering the underground groceries" — Japanese convenience stores are an experience, the variety and packaging alone.
- **Junk food adventure:** Hot Lemonade, White Grape soda, lactic acid soda — three uniquely Japanese discoveries.
- **Craft beer scene:** [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/) and [Y.Y.G. Brewery & Beer Kitchen](http://www.yygbrewery.com/) both delivered. Nate's Jalapeño IPA shouldn't work but did.
- **The pace:** After 26,000-step days, a slower day was exactly what everyone needed. Tokyo rewards wandering just as much as planning.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** Favorite drink: "YYG was great, Jalapepo IPA" (Jalapeño IPA). Favorite food: The glazed sweet potato chips were good.
- **Bear:** Favorite drinks: "Triple at the [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/), a few interesting beers at the [Y.Y.G. Brewery & Beer Kitchen](http://www.yygbrewery.com/)." Weird/fun snacks: "Hot Lemonade, White Grape soda, lactic acid soda." Something small he enjoyed: "Wandering the underground groceries."

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: Today was about taking a breath. No 26,000-step marching orders. Tea shopping — Japan takes tea seriously. Grocery stores, which sounds boring until you're staring at aisle after aisle of snacks you've never seen before. We tried Hot Lemonade (spicy lemonade), White Grape soda, and lactic acid soda (don't ask). Then craft beer at [Brussels Beer Project Shinjuku](https://burasseruzu-shinjuku.foodre.jp/) and [Y.Y.G. Brewery & Beer Kitchen](http://www.yygbrewery.com/) — Nate found a Jalapeño IPA that sounds terrible but apparently wasn't. Sometimes the best days are the ones where you just wander, curiosity over itinerary.
