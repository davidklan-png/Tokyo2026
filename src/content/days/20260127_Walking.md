## Overview

Twenty-six thousand steps took Nate, Bear, and Dave from Shinjuku's megastores through quiet park paths and into the heart of Shibuya. This was Tokyo on foot: retail therapy at Bic Camera and Uniqlo, roasted sweet potato soft serve in Yoyogi, and craft beer at a Cat Street bar that became an all-day people-watching session. The day ended at La Coquina Cerveceria with a balcony view of the most famous intersection in the world — the Shibuya crossing, pure organized chaos from above. Nobody planned that kind of distance. It just happened.

## Moments & Notes

- **Yakiimo discovery:** Roasted sweet potato ice cream sounds strange — tastes amazing. One of those "only in Japan" moments that nobody plans but everyone stumbles into.
- **Cat Street vibe:** The mid-afternoon break at SMOKEHOUSE turned into an hours-long people-watching session. Craft beer, passing crowds, and perfect conversation.
- **Shibuya from above:** Watching the scramble from above at La Coquina Cerveceria made the famous crossing look like performance art — organized chaos in perfect synchronization.
- **The unexpected distance:** Nobody counted the steps until they checked their phones at the end. 26,000. Just walking around.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** The "Tapas overlooking Shibuya" at La Coquina Cerveceria was his standout drink stop of the trip.
- **Bear:** Enjoyed "watching a street full of people playing Pokémon go" — one of those small moments that captures modern Tokyo perfectly.

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: We walked 26,000 steps today. That's roughly 13 miles. The day started with practical stuff — new electronics at Bic Camera, clothes at Uniqlo — but then we discovered yakiimo soft serve. That's roasted sweet potato ice cream, and it's unexpectedly delicious. The highlight was this bar on Cat Street called SMOKEHOUSE, where we sat for hours watching people walk by and drinking craft beer. Dinner was tapas at a restaurant overlooking the famous Shibuya crossing — you've probably seen it in movies, where hundreds of people cross from all directions at once. Seeing it live, from above, was something else. Tokyo at night feels electric.
