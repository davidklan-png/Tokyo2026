## Overview

Twenty-six thousand steps took Nate, Bear, and Dave from Shinjuku's megastores through quiet park paths and into the heart of Shibuya. This was Tokyo on foot: retail therapy at Bic Camera and Uniqlo, roasted sweet potato soft serve in Yoyogi, and craft beer at a Cat Street bar that became an all-day people-watching session. The day ended at La Coquina Cerveceria with a balcony view of the most famous intersection in the world — the Shibuya crossing, pure organized chaos from above. Nobody planned that kind of distance. It just happened.

## Moments & Notes

- **Yakiimo discovery:** Roasted sweet potato ice cream sounds strange — tastes amazing. One of those "only in Japan" moments that nobody plans but everyone stumbles into.
- **Cat Street vibe:** The mid-afternoon break at [SMOKEHOUSE](https://www.tysons.jp/smokehouse/en/) turned into an hours-long people-watching session. Craft beer, passing crowds, and perfect conversation.
- **Shibuya from above:** Watching the scramble from above at [La Coquina Cerveceria](https://www.huge.co.jp/en/service/restaurant/spanish/la_coquina/) made the famous crossing look like performance art — organized chaos in perfect synchronization.
- **The unexpected distance:** Nobody counted the steps until they checked their phones at the end. 26,000. Just walking around.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** The "Tapas overlooking Shibuya" at [La Coquina Cerveceria](https://www.huge.co.jp/en/service/restaurant/spanish/la_coquina/) was his standout drink stop of the trip.
- **Bear:** Enjoyed "watching a street full of people playing Pokémon go" — one of those small moments that captures modern Tokyo perfectly.

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: We walked 26,000 steps today. That's roughly 13 miles. The day started with practical stuff — new electronics at [Bic Camera](https://www.biccamera.co.jp/store/), clothes at Uniqlo — but then we discovered yakiimo soft serve. That's roasted sweet potato ice cream, and it's unexpectedly delicious. The highlight was this bar on Cat Street called [SMOKEHOUSE](https://www.tysons.jp/smokehouse/en/), where we sat for hours watching people walk by and drinking craft beer. Dinner was tapas at [La Coquina Cerveceria](https://www.huge.co.jp/en/service/restaurant/spanish/la_coquina/) overlooking the famous Shibuya crossing — you've probably seen it in movies, where hundreds of people cross from all directions at once. Seeing it live, from above, was something else. Tokyo at night feels electric.
