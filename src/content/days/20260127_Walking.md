## Overview

This was the walking day to end all walking days. Nate, Bear, and Dave set out on foot to cover Shinjuku, Yoyogi, and Shibuya — racking up an astonishing 26,000 steps. The itinerary was packed: shopping at Bic Camera, Uniqlo, and Mont Bell; lunch at EggSlut; yakiimo soft serve for dessert; a mid-afternoon break at Smokehouse on Cat Street; and finally, dinner at La Coquina Cerveceria, overlooking the famous Shibuya crossing. Tokyo on foot is an entirely different experience than Tokyo by train.

- **Smokehouse break:** A mid-afternoon people-watching session on Cat Street at [SMOKEHOUSE](https://www.tysons.jp/smokehouse/), complete with proper craft beers.
- **Shibuya crossing dinner:** La Coquina Cerveceria provided a front-row seat to one of Tokyo's most famous intersections — pure organized chaos from above.
- **The step count:** 26,000 steps. Everyone felt it by the end.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** The "Tapas overlooking Shibuya" at La Coquina Cerveceria was his standout drink stop of the trip.
- **Bear:** Enjoyed "watching a street full of people playing Pokémon go" — one of those small moments that captures modern Tokyo perfectly.

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: Imagine walking so much that your phone fitness app practically throws a party. That was this day — 26,000 steps, which is roughly 13 miles. We shopped for electronics at a store called Bic Camera, got clothes at Uniqlo (they have them in the U.S., but the Japan selection is different), and discovered something called yakiimo soft serve. That's roasted sweet potato ice cream. Sounds weird, tastes amazing. Later, we found this bar on Cat Street called [SMOKEHOUSE](https://www.tysons.jp/smokehouse/) where we sat and watched people walk by. Dinner was at a restaurant overlooking the famous Shibuya crossing — you've probably seen it in movies or on TV, where hundreds of people cross at once from all directions. We ate tapas and watched it happen. Tokyo is absolutely magical at night.
