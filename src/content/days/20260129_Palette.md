## Overview

Day five was, by unanimous agreement, the culinary peak — afternoon relaxation at [Toshimaen Niwa-no-yu](https://www.seibu-leisure.co.jp/niwanoyu/index.html) super onsen, evening excellence at Palette 814. Nate, Bear, and Dave soaked away accumulated miles; the foot massage alone justified the experience. Then came dinner with Taz, Aya-san, Cayo-san, and Tecchan — the best food of the trip, shared warmth, laughter from friends who've become family. Cayo-san told Bear he looked like [Peter Aerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Aerts). The pork changed Nate's life. Strangers became family.

- **The company:** Dinner with friends in their neighborhood restaurant, laughter and welcome — this was what the trip was really about.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** Best food of the trip: "The pork at palette814." The first thing he wanted to tell family about: "Dinner at palette814." On the onsen: "Tightest swimsuit ever. Amazing foot massage."
- **Bear:** Best food of the trip: "The entire meal at Palette." On the onsen: "Reasonably priced spa type experience, very chill." On sharing dinner with friends: "Our host said I looked like [Peter Aerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Aerts), and it was a very warm and inviting evening."

## A Message from Cayo-san

After everyone returned home, Cayo-san sent this message (translated from Japanese):

*"Hello! ☀️ Were Nate and Bear able to enjoy Tokyo safely? It must be about time for you to go home, isn't it? Thank you so much for coming all the way to Nerima to eat with us, even though it got late. Even though our Japanese isn't great, our English is much worse, but seeing everyone having such a good time really put us at ease. When Dave and Taz come to Michigan, I'm seriously thinking of inviting myself along, so please take us on a Michigan tour then! 🪵🐿️🚙🦌🦔🌳 Please get home safely! ✈️"*

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: Today was special. Afternoon at an onsen — traditional Japanese hot spring spa with pools of varying temperatures, then a foot massage that melts away walking miles. That was [Toshimaen Niwa-no-yu](https://www.seibu-leisure.co.jp/niwanoyu/index.html). Then came dinner at Palette 814 with Dave and Taz's Japanese friends: Cayo-san, her daughter Aya-san, and Tecchan. The pork? Nate said it was the best thing he ate in Japan; Bear said the whole meal was the best. But more than food — Cayo-san told Bear he looked like [Peter Aerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Aerts) (legendary K-1 fighter), apparently a huge compliment. When we got home, Cayo-san sent a message about how happy she was we came, how she wants to visit Michigan someday. Strangers became family. That's what this trip was really about.
