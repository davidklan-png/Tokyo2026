## Overview

Day five was, by unanimous agreement, the culinary peak of the trip. The afternoon began at Niwanoyu, a super onsen at Toshimaen, where Nate, Bear, and Dave soaked away the accumulated walking miles. The swimsuits were tight, but the foot massage was amazing. In the evening, the group gathered at Palette 814 in Heiwadai for what would become the definitive meal of the trip — joined by Taz, Aya-san (Cayo's daughter), Cayo-san, and Tecchan. It wasn't just the food (which was incredible); it was the warmth, the laughter, and the feeling of being welcomed by friends who've become family.

## Moments & Notes

- **Onsen firsts:** For Nate and Bear, this was their first onsen experience. "Tightest swimsuit ever," according to Nate, but the foot massage alone made it worthwhile.
- **The meal:** Both Nate and Bear identified Palette 814 as the best food of the trip. Nate called out the pork specifically; Bear simply said "the entire meal at Palette."
- **The reception:** Bear received what might be the compliment of the century — Cayo-san told him he looked like a Japanese wrestler. "It was a very warm and inviting evening."
- **The company:** Sharing dinner with friends in Japan, in their neighborhood restaurant, surrounded by laughter and good food — this was what the trip was really about.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** Best food of the trip: "The pork at palette814." The first thing he wanted to tell family about: "Dinner at palette814." On the onsen: "Tightest swimsuit ever. Amazing foot massage."
- **Bear:** Best food of the trip: "The entire meal at Palette." On the onsen: "Reasonably priced spa type experience, very chill." On sharing dinner with friends: "Our host said I looked like a Japanese wrestler, and it was a very warm and inviting evening."

## A Message from Cayo-san

After everyone returned home, Cayo-san sent this message (translated from Japanese):

*"Hello! ☀️ Were Nate and Bear able to enjoy Tokyo safely? It must be about time for you to go home, isn't it? Thank you so much for coming all the way to Nerima to eat with us, even though it got late. Our Japanese isn't great, so we could barely speak English, but seeing everyone having such a good time really put us at ease. When Dave and Taz come to Michigan, I'm seriously thinking of inviting myself along, so please take us on a Michigan tour then! 🪵🐿️🚙🦌🦔🌳 Please get home safely! ✈️"*

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: Today was special. We spent the afternoon at an onsen — a traditional Japanese hot spring spa. Imagine the most relaxing place you can imagine, with different pools of varying temperatures, and then someone gives you a foot massage that melts away all the walking. That was Niwanoyu. Then came dinner — and you need to understand how important this dinner was. We went to a restaurant called Palette 814 with Dave and Taz's Japanese friends: Cayo-san, her daughter Aya-san, and Tecchan. The pork? According to Nate, it was the best thing he ate in Japan. Bear said the whole meal was the best. But more than the food — Cayo-san told Bear he looked like a Japanese wrestler, which is apparently a huge compliment. When we got home, Cayo-san sent us this message about how happy she was we came, and how she wants to come to Michigan someday and have us show her around. These people, who started as strangers, became family. That's what this trip was really about.
