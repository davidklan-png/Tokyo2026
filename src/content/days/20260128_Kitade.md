## Overview

Day four took the crew to Shimokitazawa, one of Tokyo's most eclectic neighborhoods. The day started pragmatically — Nate headed to ABC Mart to get more comfortable walking shoes after the previous day's 26,000-step marathon. Once Nate, Bear, and Dave reunited, it was time to explore. Village Vanguard delivered on its reputation for strange and wonderful goods, but the real highlight was Kitade Tacos — great food with service so memorably odd it became part of the trip lore.

## Moments & Notes

- **The shoe emergency:** After 26,000 steps the previous day, Nate's boots weren't cutting it. ABC Mart provided the solution — comfy shoes that would carry him through the rest of the trip.
- **Village Vanguard:** This legendary store lived up to its reputation. The collection was genuinely eclectic — Nate spotted gyoza zippered pouches, among other things.
- **[Kitade Tacos Shimokitazawa](https://kitadeshokudo.com/):** The food was legitimately great, but the service was something else entirely. "Beyond strange" was Nate's assessment.
- **The cabbage revelation:** Bear discovered that cabbage with vinegar needs to be added to the taco canon. "Delightfully strange" doesn't quite cover it.

## What Nate and Bear said

- **Nate:** On Village Vanguard: "Really eclectic collection including gyoza zippered pouch." On [Kitade Tacos Shimokitazawa](https://kitadeshokudo.com/): "Food was great, service was beyond strange."
- **Bear:** On [Kitade Tacos Shimokitazawa](https://kitadeshokudo.com/): "Cabbage with vinegar needs to be made for tacos. Delightfully strange."

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: So after walking 26,000 steps the day before, Nate's feet were done. He had to go buy new shoes — that's how much walking we're talking about. Once we were all reunited in Shimokitazawa, we went to this store called Village Vanguard that sells the weirdest stuff you can imagine. Imagine a store that sells gyoza-shaped zipper pouches. That's Village Vanguard. Then we went to this taco place called [Kitade Tacos Shimokitazawa](https://kitadeshokudo.com/). The food was actually really good, but the service was... well, "beyond strange." Bear discovered that cabbage with vinegar is a game-changer for tacos, which is now a thing we apparently believe as a family. Tokyo keeps surprising us.
