## Overview

Day four began with a practical emergency: new shoes for Nate after 26,000 steps. But what followed was pure Shimokitazawa — Village Vanguard's gyoza-shaped pouches and bizarre merchandise, then Kitade Tacos, where genuinely great food met service so memorably strange it became trip lore. Bear discovered that cabbage with vinegar belongs in tacos. Some days you plan; some days you just find yourself eating tacos with cabbage in Tokyo's quirkiest neighborhood.

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: After 26,000 steps the previous day, Nate's feet were done — new shoes were mandatory. Then Shimokitazawa happened. [Village Vanguard](https://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/village-vanguard-shimokitazawa/30231) sells gyoza-shaped zipper pouches and the weirdest stuff you can imagine. Then came [Kitade Tacos Shimokitazawa](https://kitadeshokudo.com/) — great food, service so strange it became legendary. Bear discovered that cabbage with vinegar is a taco game-changer, which is apparently a family belief now. Tokyo keeps surprising us.
