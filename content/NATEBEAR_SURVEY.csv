I enjoyed the spirituality of the people and the place, the smells of incense and whatever the shops had to offer.  It was an experience for the senses that I very much enjoyed.","I stood out on the boat.  Standing outside in the middle of the Tokyo night was as quiet and serene as it gets in a fairly quiet and serene city,","Beef Curry at the Sakura lounge.","More junk food, more time sitting and people watching.  More time at the temple.  Some nature walks and some out of Tokyo experiences.  DisneySea.  All the food, all over again.","Beautiful city, lots of walking, lots of food and adult drinking.

The most memorable parts of the trip were the people, not the destinations.  Dave and Taz as our gracious hosts, Dave’s surrogate mother who looked at him with doting eyes relentlessly at the first restaurant, Dave’s friends who owned the restaurant and were so warm and welcoming, Ankhet’s (sp?) constant laughter.

Even our Aussie and New Zealander sumo wrestling  friends on the train were a joy.

The people of Japan as a whole were friendly and welcoming, perhaps sometimes disingenuous, but I never noticed."
