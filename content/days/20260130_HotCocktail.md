## Overview

Day six took the crew to some of Tokyo's most storied neighborhoods. It started at Ueno Park for the Hot Cocktail Festival — yes, that's a real thing — where Ankit, Nate, Bear, and Dave sampled creative drinks amid festival atmosphere. From there, it was through the bustling Ameyokocho street market, then on to Akihabara, electric town and anime mecca, in search of Sonic the Hedgehog merch. Waffles and pancakes were acquired. Candy was purchased. Sonic was... well, we'll get to that.

- **The Sonic hunt:** The group searched multiple shops in Akihabara, anime and gaming capital of Japan, for Sonic merchandise. Bear's conclusion: "No, he doesn't exist in Japan."
- **Candy variety packs:** Bear found and acquired Japanese candy variety packs — those assortments of weird and wonderful snacks that make perfect souvenirs.
- **Festival vibes:** The Hot Cocktail Festival at Ueno Park was one of those "only in Japan" experiences — creative cocktails in a park setting, complete with all the festival energy you'd expect.

## What Nate and Bear said

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: We went to a hot cocktail festival. In a park. That's a thing that exists in Japan — imagine a regular festival, but instead of corn dogs and lemonade, it's creative hot cocktails and gourmet appetizers. Then we walked through Ameyokocho, which is this insane street market with stalls crammed full of everything — clothes, food, souvenirs, you name it. After that, Akihabara — the electric town, home of all things anime and video games. We went looking for Sonic the Hedgehog stuff. Surely Japan, home of Sonic, would have plenty of it, right? Wrong. Bear searched multiple shops and concluded: "Sonic doesn't exist in Japan." We did find waffles and pancakes, though. And candy. Lots of candy.
