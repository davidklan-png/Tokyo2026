## Walking Day

Today we set out on foot to really experience Tokyo. No trains, no taxis - just walking and exploring.

### Street Food Adventures

We tried so many amazing snacks from street vendors. Takoyaki was definitely the kids' favorite!

### Temple Visit

Stumbled upon a beautiful shrine tucked away in a quiet neighborhood.
