The journey from Chicago to Tokyo marks the official start of Nate and Bear's Japanese adventure. After crossing the international date line, flight NH11 landed at Narita at 3PM on January 25th. From there, it was a whirlwind introduction to Japanese efficiency — the Narita Express, the famously orderly subway system, and a late-night izakaya dinner that set the tone for the days to come.

## For the kids

Leah, Caleb, Molly, Dexter, and Archer: The flights were long, but touching down in Tokyo felt like stepping into another world. The trains don't just run on time — they're *quiet*. People actually wait in lines. The subway isn't loud or chaotic; it's this incredibly organized system where everyone just knows what to do. Dad's first move was to take everyone to an izakaya — a Japanese pub where the food comes in small plates and the atmosphere is pure energy. Welcome to Japan!
