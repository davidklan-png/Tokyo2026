## Arrival

After our long flight from home, we finally touched down in Tokyo! The kids were so excited to see the city lights as we flew in.

### Getting to the Hotel

We took the Narita Express into the city. The train was comfortable and gave us our first glimpses of the Japanese countryside.

### First Impressions

Tokyo is incredible! The scale of everything is overwhelming but in the best way possible.
